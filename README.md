# Lightweight JavaScript Vimrc
This is an intentionally minimal vimrc, it's currently being used in an hostile windows environment - the modules have been carefully chosen due to their minimal performance impact.

```
git clone https://github.com/posbo/vimrc.git ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
cd ~/.vim && git submodule init
```
